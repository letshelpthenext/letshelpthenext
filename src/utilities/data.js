    sincere heartfelt gratitude for your generous assistance and paying half of my
    tuition. Your support came at a very critical moment when I was facing significant
    financial challenges, especially after recently getting married. Managing finances
    while starting a new life together has been difficult and your
    timely help truly rescued me when I needed it the most. Because of your kindness
    and generosity, I've been able to relieve a great deal of stress and fully dedicatemy
    attention and energy to my studies. Having the freedom to concentrate more deeply on my
    academics has significantly enhanced my learning experience and academic performance.

    my personal life, giving me more stability and confidence during this important time. I am
    truly grateful for your willingness to step in and provide help in such a meaningful way.

    message: `I am from Taiwan. 3 and half years before I came to BYU-Idaho I was volunteering
    for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for one and half years. Then, I worked
    for an after school organization for around one and half years. Coming to BYU-Idaho has been
    a dream since when I was a teen. Therefore, I tried my best to save money for this goal.

    My father passed away the year I came to BYU-Idaho. I wasn't sure if I should come or not.
    He is my best friend and financial support. He taught me to do things when you feel like you
    need to do them. I know the importance of getting an education. My father and I have this
    expectation for me to come and study at BYU-Idaho. So, I made the decision to come and study.

    I am very proud of myself that I came to the United States to be educated in my second language.
    I was able to find a job on campus. I try to keep my GPA above 3.8 while having my family and
    work at the same time. I found my passion in college. I love the apparel industry. I have been
    learning and taking classes in apparel. I made a beautiful skirt and a top for my friend Fall 2024.

    My goals are to master my sewing skills before I graduate and learn to be a leader. My dream
    is to open my own apparel business and to connect this skill and leadership skills to education.
    I hope to bring things I learned here back home to strengthen the community and the country.

    "Let's Help the Next" helped me for my Fall 2025 semester, so I can put more effort into my
    school and not worry about money. This is a big step for my achievement at BYU-Idaho. I believe
    that everyone has the potential to bring something great into somebody's life. "Let's Help the Next"
    is an example of that. I will continue to share the light with the people around me

    Thank you, Nini

    message: `My name is Natasha Kunda, and I’m from Zambia, a small but beautiful country in the southern
      part of Africa. Growing up there was not easy. I lost my father when I was very young, and my
      mother was left to raise me and my older siblings all on her own. Life was difficult, but my mom
      always reminded us to hold onto hope and education even when it felt like our world was falling
      apart.

      After high school, I dreamed of going to college, but in Zambia, opportunities are very limited.
      The economy was struggling, jobs were almost impossible to find, and I watched my siblings
      even those with degrees unable to find work. I saw how hard my mother worked and how much
      she sacrificed for us, and I knew deep down that if I stayed, my future would not be any
      different

      So, I made a brave decision: I wanted to come to the United States to get a better education
      and build a future not only for myself, but for my mom and my family. My mother, even with so
      little, gave me everything she had, her savings, her faith, and her blessings,to help me chase
      that dream. I came to the U.S. with big hopes, but I quickly learned that dreams don’t come
      easy.
      When I arrived, I had no financial support. I worked part-time while studying full-time just to pay
      rent, tuition, and all the other bills that came my way. I couldn’t ask my mother for more because
      she had already given me all she could. I was determined to keep going for her, for my family,
      and for the little girl inside me who still believed that education could change everything.
      I chose to major in Early Childhood and Special Education because I have always loved
      children. They bring me so much joy, and I want to make a difference in their lives,especially for
      children with special needs, who often don’t have enough support in my country. Helping them
      learn and grow has been one of my greatest blessings.
      But two semesters ago, I hit a very dark moment in my life. I had been pushing myself too hard
      working, studying, and trying to stay strong for everyone back home. I wanted to graduate
      quickly so I could finally help my mom. But the pressure became too much. I found myself
      mentally and emotionally exhausted. I went to class, but I couldn’t focus. I was physically there,
      but mentally lost.
      Eventually, I reached out for professional help, and I was diagnosed with severe depression.
      My doctor advised me to take a break from school and work,to focus on healing. But in my
      culture, taking time off for mental health isn’t something we talk about. I felt ashamed and guilty
      for not being strong enough. I kept thinking, “If I don’t graduate, how will I ever help my mom?”
      Still, I knew that if I didn’t take care of myself, I couldn’t take care of anyone else. I took one
      semester off, even though that meant I couldn’t work and had no income. That was one of the
      hardest times in my life. I didn’t know how I would pay for tuition, housing, or even food.

      One day, a close friend from Zambia told me about “Let’s Help The Next”, an organization that
      had helped her when she was struggling. I decided to reach out, though I didn’t expect anything.
      Days passed, maybe weeks and then, finally, I got an email back. That moment changed
      everything.
      For the first time in a long time, I felt seen. I felt hope again. The support from “Let’s Help the
      Next” reminded me that I wasn’t a failure, that I was still fighting, still moving forward, and still
      capable of achieving my dream. Because of their help, I was able to continue my studies and
      stay on track to graduate.
      Now, I’m preparing for my student teaching, something I’ve looked forward to since I started
      this journey. I’m grateful every single day for the people who believed in me, for the children
      who remind me why I chose this path, and for my mom, who never stopped believing in me
      even when things looked impossible.
      When I earn my degree, and raise enough funds I want to go back to Zambia and create
      opportunities for children with special needs, something that’s still lacking there. I want to
      use what I’ve learned here to train teachers, open centers for learning, and make sure every
      child no matter their ability has a chance to reach their potential.
      And just as “Let’s Help the Next” helped me when I was at my lowest, I want to do the same for
      others. I know what it feels like to be alone, scared, and ready to give up and I want to be the
      reason someone chooses to keep going.
      My story it’s about hope, faith, and second chances. It’s about believing that even when life
      feels impossible, kindness can change everything.Thank You.

    message: `I’m from Ghana, where education is accessible and deeply
      valued. Growing up, I was surrounded by people who encouraged hard
      work and discipline, and those lessons shaped how I approach challenges
      today. Even with opportunities available, I learned that success depends
      on consistency, focus, and the ability to keep going when things get difficult.

      Before starting school at BYU-Idaho, my life was structured but familiar.
      I was comfortable in my environment and routines. Moving to a new country to
      continue my education brought a new set of challenges, such as adjusting to a
      different culture, learning style, and pace of life. There were moments of uncertainty,
      but I used those experiences to strengthen my independence and resilience.

      Throughout my academic journey, I’ve worked hard to balance multiple responsibilities,
      from coursework and projects to personal growth. I’ve achieved milestones that reflect
      not just academic progress but personal transformation. Each challenge I’ve faced has
      helped me become more adaptable, focused, and confident in who I am and what I can accomplish.

      Looking ahead, I hope to build a meaningful career  where creativity and problem-solving meet.
      My goal is to create work that inspires and makes a difference while continuing to grow as
      a person and a professional. I believe that perseverance opens doors, and I’m committed to
      walking through every one that leads me closer to my dreams.`,

      Political Science with an emphasis on Foreign Affairs.

      Growing up in a small town in northern Albania taught me that even in the smallest places, you can
      dream big, but you also have to work really hard for it.

      I’ve been so blessed to have an incredible support system, including Let’s Help The Next. Their support
      wasn’t just financial for me, it felt like there were people out there who truly cared about international students studying here in the U.S.

      Because yes, financial help makes a huge difference, but what matters most is knowing that someone
      believes in you and wants to see you succeed, no matter where you come from.

      My dream is to one day be in a position where I can help other international students achieve their own
      educational goals, whether here in the United States or anywhere they dream to study. And beyond that, I hope to make a difference in my country, using the knowledge and experience I’m gaining from BYU–Idaho to give back and create opportunities for others.

      Dzaleka Refugee Camp in Malawi where I lived for about 15 years before moving to the USA
      for education. Growing up in the camp was not easy. Access to education was limited, and
      resources were scarce. But one thing for sure, I always believed that education was my
      path to freedom and hope.
      Despite the challenges from studying in overcrowded classrooms, to facing uncertainty
      about the future, I worked hard and held on to my dream of one day going to college.
      Through perseverance, faith, and the kindness of people who believed in me, that dream
      became a reality.
      In July, I received my Bachelor of Art in International Studies from BYU-Idaho, and Today, I
      am pursuing a Master of Public Administration at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. I
      have worked with organizations such as the Global Campaign for Education–US, using my
      story to amplify the voices of refugee youth and push for policies that improve access to
      education. My experiences have strengthened my passion for refugee education and
      advocacy.
      Recently, I was honored to give a speech at Economic Social Counsil Youth Forum 2025 at
      the United Nations Headquarters, representing young people from marginalized
      communities. Standing there reminded me that my voice and the voices of millions of
      young refugees matter more than ever.
      The scholarship I received through Let’s Help The Next made a very huge difference in my
      life. Not only did it help to cover my educational costs, but it also gave me confidence, a
      reminder that I am not alone on this journey. It showed me that there are people out there
      who care, who believe in investing in students like me.
      My goal is to use my education to create better systems and opportunities for young
      refugees around the world, especially in early childhood and higher education. I want to
      continue being a bridge between refugee communities and policymakers, ensuring that no
      young person’s potential is lost because of where they were born.
      Thank you for believing in me and for helping make this journey possible. Your support is
      changing lives and mine is just one example.
      With gratitude,
      Divine Irakoze

      I'm from Brazil, and I arrived in the United States six months ago. In the beginning of the winter semester, I was really
      worried about my tuition because I was using the international student deposits to pay it. However, after I used all the
      available funds, I was missing $800 US, and I didn't have this money. I was really worried because even though I was working
      hard to get an academic scholarship, the evaluation for BYU-Idaho academic scholarships happened after the winter semester.
      As I was trying to see what I can do, I applied for the Let's Help The Next Need-Based scholarship. This scholarship helped me
      a lot. It helped me to focus on my studies, and in my part-time job where I work to pay my rent. As a result I had  a good semester,
      and I am at the end of the semester and I got most of the grades that I need. I believe that starting in fall I'm going to start
      receiving my academic scholarship, and it was all possible because let's help the next so I'm really grateful for the help that they give me.

      A little bit about me.
      I am from a family of four. I have an older sister, and she is 26 years old. She has already graduated and
      gotten married. My mother is a hair stylist, and she works at home. My father builds windows, doors, garage doors,
      and structures made of aluminum also at home. They both taught me the value of hard work. I learned from both of
      my parents. As a result, I took a barber course before coming here, so I have barber skills. Honestly, because their
      jobs are not stable employment, they only have money when they have work.
      As a result, I'm always trying to work hard to get help for my tuition and for my expenses. They are trying to help me,
      but sometimes they cannot do it entirely. So that's why I'm doing my best to work hard, also cutting hair and working on
      campus right now. I already received the Let's Help the Nets need-based scholarship. This helps me because now this
