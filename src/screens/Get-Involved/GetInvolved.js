  financially. Throughout my college experience, I have met incredible people who have shown me kindness,
  love, and emotional, and cognitive support. Their counsel still guides me through this day.
  We believe in paying it forward, to whoever the opportunity is presented because life can be difficult
  for international students away from home for too long and facing up financial difficulties over time.
  This organization exists to provide breathing room to those who need financial assistance.`;

  in the power of humanity and kindness, we are committed to using our skills and experience to create meaningful
  change and make the world a better place for all. We know we have limitations and cannot do it all. So, we
  welcome all the assistance we can get to continue making positive changes in the lives of many.`;

  better their own lives are those who will one day be able to help the next!`;

                  Money is not the only commodity that is fun to give. You can give your time,
                  your expertise, your love, or simply give a smile. What does that cost?
                  The point is, none of us can ever run out of something worthwhile to give.
