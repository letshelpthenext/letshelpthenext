                  Let's Help the Next is thrilled to announce an exciting new direction
                  in our efforts to support international students, currently with a
                  particular focus on those studying at Brigham Young University-Idaho
                  (BYU-I). Three of the founding Board members are alumnus of BYU-I and
                  know the needs that international students face. With this in mind,
                  the Board has unanimously agreed to focus our efforts on helping
                  students who need help to continue their education.

                  International students face a myriad of challenges when they embark on
                  their educational journey far from home. From navigating cultural
                  differences to managing financial constraints, the transition can be
                  overwhelming. For those who have served missions, these challenges are
                  often compounded by the readjustment to academic life and the
                  balancing act between their spiritual commitments and scholastic
                  responsibilities.

                  Our mission is to provide a support system that addresses the specific
                  needs of these students. By focusing on church members, and
                  particularly returned missionaries, we acknowledge their dedication
                  and service while ensuring they have the resources and guidance needed
                  to thrive academically and personally. Our new direction is rooted in
                  the belief that supporting these students enriches not only their
                  lives but also the broader community at BYU-I, mission of the Church,
                  and will positively affect future generations of faithful followers of
                  Jesus Christ.

                    One of our core initiatives was to establish a relationship with the

                    pairing international students with other students who have
                    successfully navigated their educational journey. This peer support
                    provides guidance, foster connections, and create a sense of
                    community, helping students feel less isolated and more integrated

                    Understanding the financial burdens that many international students

                    economic pressures, allowing students to focus more on their studies
                    and less on financial worries.
