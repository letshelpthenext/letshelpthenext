      testimony: "I was trying to study abroad three years ago, but unsuccessfully. That is when I met Mishma through my cousin. I went to her, and I asked her if she could help me apply for a university where she is, and she accepted to help me. One month after, we started the application and paperwork. It was challenging for me and for her given the situation in which my country was at this time. We first started with getting me documents like passport, pictures, etc. After I got my passport, we applied for an English program at the University of Utah. Two weeks after, we received a letter that said that I got accepted to the program. My family and I were super happy. After that, we had scheduled an appointment with the US embassy for September, but because of the situation of the country, my appointment was reported for December. I was very stressed because I was worried that the situation of the country would have affected my chance to get my visa. Notwithstanding the situation of the country, I stayed positive. In December, I received my student visa. I was very happy. Two weeks later, I flew to Idaho where I met Mishma. My number one concern at this time was to find a place where to live. Mishma with her contacts found me a host family which today has become my family in the US. A year later, after I got transferred to BYU-I, Mishma secretly opened a GoFundMe for me which helped me get started as a college student. Today, I am studying Business Operations, but want to change my major to Software Engineering.",

      testimony: "I met Mishma a year ago through a friend. My friend Kim introduced me to her and asked if she could help me as I was applying for school. After getting the school admission, I was super worried that I was not going to have a visa since I had no idea on how to go about it. Fortunately I had Mishma who helped me with the application and helped me prepare for the visa interviews. I was approved for the visa and that was the happiest moment of my life though I was still worried about one thing. Despite me having a visa that would allow me to arrive in the United States, I still did not have money to go to school. However, guess what? My friends Kim and Mishma helped me raise money through GoFundMe. It's been a long journey, full of ups and downs, but I am so excited to tell you all that we made it and I am finally in the United States, starting school next week.",

      testimony: "My experience with Let's Help the Next has been very satisfying. Regarding the admission and integration process to the university, she helped me find an available university where there was an ongoing session opening. In addition, she accompanied me in all the administrative procedures related to registration, university admission and visa application procedures. Regarding the latter, she helped me fill out the visa application form and collect documents. Then, she had planned my appointment at the Embassy herself. In fact, it was a very good experience, I appreciate her dedication and rigor in supporting my university admission last year (2021).",
      originalTestimony: "Mon exp√©rience avec ... a √©t√© tr√®s satisfaisante. En ce qui concerne, le processus d'admission et d'int√©gration √† l'universit√©, elle m'a aid√©e √† trouver une universit√© disponible o√π il y avait une session en cours d'ouverture. En outre, elle m'a accompagn√©e dans toutes les d√©marches administratives li√©es aux inscriptions, l'admission √† l'universit√© et les proc√©dures de demande visa. Concernant ce dernier, elle m'a aid√© √† remplir le formulaire de demande de visa et la collecte des documents. Puis, elle avait planifi√© elle-m√™me mon rendez-vous √† l'Ambassade. En fait, C'√©tait une tr√®s bonne exp√©rience, j'appr√©cie son d√©vouement et sa rigueur dans l'accompagnement de mon admission √† l'universit√© l'ann√©e derni√®re ( 2021).",
